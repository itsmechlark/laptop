# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

`itsmechlark/laptop` provisions a macOS machine for web and mobile development,
and it carries the maintainer's AI-agent configuration as a second payload.

Two things live here:

1. **`mac`** — a single POSIX `sh` script that installs Homebrew packages, asdf
   language runtimes, and databases. It is idempotent: it installs, upgrades, or
   skips based on what's already on the machine, and is safe to re-run.
2. **Agent configuration** — `.agents/`, `rules/`, `skills/`, `.claude/`. The
   `mac` script symlinks these into `~/.agents` and `~/.claude`, so this repo is
   the single source of truth for how coding agents behave on every machine that
   has run it.

There is no build step, no package manager, and no application code. The only
language is POSIX shell plus Markdown.

### Read this first: two different AGENTS.md files

| File | Scope | Symlinked to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` (this file) | Instructions for working **on this repository** | nowhere |
| `.agents/AGENTS.md` | The maintainer's **global engineering standards**, shipped to every project | `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |

`.agents/AGENTS.md` is cargo, not configuration for this repo. Editing it
changes agent behavior in *every* repository on the machine — treat changes to
it as global blast radius and keep them deliberate.

## Setup commands

Nothing needs installing to work on this repo beyond the linter:

```sh
brew install shellcheck
```

To run the provisioner itself (this mutates the machine — installs packages,
runs `sudo chsh`, and rewrites `~/.zshrc`):

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

The run log is the primary debugging artifact; keep the lines where it failed.

## Repository layout

```
mac                     # the provisioner (POSIX sh, shellcheck-clean)
README.md               # human-facing docs — update alongside `mac`
skills-lock.json        # provenance + content hashes for vendored skills
.agents/
  AGENTS.md             # global engineering standards (shipped to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
  AGENTS.local.md       # machine-local overrides — git-ignored
  skills/               # vendored third-party skills (tracked in skills-lock.json)
rules/                  # path-scoped language standards, auto-loaded by glob
skills/                 # first-party skills; vendored ones are symlinks into .agents/skills
.claude/settings.json   # Claude Code settings (permissions, sandbox, hooks, plugins)
.github/workflows/      # CI
```

### Symlink map

`mac` (see `symlink_path`, near the end of the script) creates:

| Link | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` | `.agents/AGENTS.md` |
| `~/.agents/rules` | `rules/` |
| `~/.agents/skills` | `skills/` |
| `~/.agents/.skills-lock.json` | `skills-lock.json` |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` |
| `~/.claude/rules` | `~/.agents/rules` |
| `~/.claude/skills` | `~/.agents/skills` |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json` |

**Consequence:** because directories are linked (not copied), editing a rule or
skill in this repo takes effect immediately — no re-run of `mac` required. Only
adding a *new top-level* link needs `sh mac` again. `symlink_path` moves any
pre-existing real file to `<path>.backup` before linking; check for stray
`.backup` files if a link looks wrong.

## Testing instructions

There is no unit test suite. Verification is lint plus a real run.

```sh
shellcheck mac -e SC2039     # must be clean; SC2039 is excluded deliberately
```

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, on push to `main`, every PR, and
`workflow_dispatch`) runs a matrix of `macos-26` and `macos-15` with
`fail-fast: false`, and does:

1. `brew update`
2. `brew install shellcheck`
3. `shellcheck mac -e SC2039`
4. Unlink Homebrew's preinstalled `node` if present (runner-only workaround —
   the guard is `brew list node` so it never fails on runners without it)
5. `sh mac`

For changes to `mac`, the real test is a run on a **fresh macOS install**. Use a
[UTM] VM: prepare one machine with macOS installed and first launch complete,
then duplicate it before each test run. CI covers the happy path on a runner,
which is not the same as a clean laptop.

State plainly when you have only linted and not executed the script — do not
claim a `mac` change works because shellcheck passed.

## Code style

### `mac` (POSIX shell)

- Target `#!/bin/sh`, not bash. `local` is used and SC3043 is disabled
  file-wide; SC2039 is excluded at the call site.
- **Every operation must be idempotent.** Follow the existing
  install-or-update shape (`gem_install_or_update`, `add_or_update_asdf_plugin`,
  `symlink_path` returning early when the link already matches). Re-running the
  script must be a no-op.
- Announce each phase with `fancy_echo`, matching the `"Doing thing ..."` style.
- Two-space indent. `set -e` plus the `trap ... EXIT` at the top mean any
  unguarded non-zero exit aborts the run — guard optional steps explicitly.
- Homebrew packages go in the `brew bundle --file=- <<EOF` heredoc, grouped by
  the existing comment headings (`# Unix`, `# GitHub`, `# Databases`, …).
- Scope `# shellcheck disable=` directives as narrowly as possible and leave
  them adjacent to the line they excuse.
- Anything user-specific belongs in `~/.laptop.local`, which is sourced at the
  end of the run — not in `mac`.

### `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

YAML frontmatter then Markdown:

```markdown
---
name: kebab-case-name          # must match the directory name
description: What it does, and the triggers that should invoke it.
argument-hint: "[what the argument means]"   # optional
disable-model-invocation: true               # optional; user-invoked only
---
```

The `description` is what an agent matches against, so lead with the capability
and spell out concrete trigger phrases. Long-form material goes in
`skills/<name>/references/*.md` rather than bloating `SKILL.md`.

### `rules/<lang>.md`

Frontmatter is a glob list controlling when the rule auto-loads:

```markdown
---
paths:
  - "**/*.rb"
  - "**/Gemfile"
---
```

### Vendored skills

Third-party skills live in `.agents/skills/<name>/`, are recorded in
`skills-lock.json` with their source and content hash, and are exposed through a
symlink at `skills/<name>` → `../.agents/skills/<name>`. Don't hand-edit vendored
content: it desynchronizes the recorded hash. Re-vendor from upstream and update
`skills-lock.json` instead.

### Markdown

Match the surrounding file. `README.md` uses setext underlined headings and
reference-style links; the `.agents/` and `skills/` Markdown uses ATX (`##`)
headings. Keep prose wrapped at roughly the width already in the file.

## Documentation

`README.md` is the human-facing counterpart to this file. When you change `mac`
— especially the `brew bundle` list or what gets symlinked — update the
corresponding README section in the same commit. The "What it sets up" list is
expected to stay in sync with the heredoc.

## Commit and pull request guidelines

- **Never commit or push unless explicitly asked.** A one-time approval covers
  that instance only.
- **Never add AI attribution** — no `Co-Authored-By` AI trailer, no "Generated
  with …" footer. `.claude/settings.json` sets `attribution.commit` to empty to
  enforce this.
- Conventional Commits, imperative mood. Scopes in use here: `mac`, `skills`,
  `agents`, `ci`, `docs` — e.g. `fix(mac): set up asdf via PATH instead of
  asdf.sh`, `feat(skills): add create-agentsmd skill`.
- Keep PRs single-purpose; separate refactors from behavior changes.
- Required before opening a PR: `shellcheck mac -e SC2039` clean, and a fresh-VM
  run for anything touching `mac`.
- `@itsmechlark` owns every path via `CODEOWNERS` and reviews all PRs.

The `git-commit` and `pull-request` skills in `skills/` define the full message
and description templates — use them.

## Security

- Report vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security Advisories][advisory],
  never a public issue. See `SECURITY.md`.
- No secrets, credentials, tokens, or personal paths in tracked files. Anything
  machine-specific belongs in `.agents/AGENTS.local.md` or `~/.laptop.local`,
  both of which are outside version control.
- `.claude/settings.json` is a security boundary: its `permissions.deny` list
  blocks reads of `.env` files, SSH/GPG/cloud credentials, and destructive git
  commands, and the `sandbox` block constrains filesystem writes and network
  egress. Widening either is a deliberate act — justify it in the commit message
  rather than loosening a rule to make a task easier.

## Gotchas

- `mac` will `sudo chsh` and append to `~/.zshrc`. It is not side-effect free;
  never run it casually to "check something."
- `.gitignore` excludes `artifacts`, `*.swp`, `.claude/.cc-writes`,
  `.agents/*.local.md`, `.agents/.skills-lock.json`, and any nested
  `.claude` directory under `.agents/` or `skills/`.
- `skills-lock.json` at the root is the tracked file — edit that one. The
  `.agents/.skills-lock.json` symlink pointing back at it is a leftover from when
  `~/.agents` was itself a link to this repo, and is git-ignored.
- asdf is put on `PATH` via `${ASDF_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.asdf}/shims` rather than
  sourcing `asdf.sh` — that was a deliberate fix (commit `0f46cb9`); don't
  regress it.
- The script installs the *latest* Ruby and Node that asdf reports, not pinned
  versions. Output differs between runs on different days by design.
